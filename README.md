### ABOUT
This profile was designed and created by MadKreator37. All parts were cut and modified from the 3d model of the P-47D cockpit. Every piece used is specific to the P-47D.  The hope is to bring you the most complete, visually appealing and easy to use profile for Eagle Dynamics's P-47D module for DCS that I could.

### Known Bugs and Issues


### Notes

-Due to the wide range of displays, monitors, TV's and tablets,  I cannot guarantee exact brightness levels or color accuracy results from user to user. This is not something I have any control of. If you have visual issues (too bright or too dark etc)  please calibrate your display and/or adjust settings in your GPU's software, brightness, contrast, sharpness, gamma, digital vibrance etc.(highly recommended anyway). It will probably enhance all other profiles as well. During testing, the profile was used and shown on multiple displays, and types,  to rule out any "game breaking" visuals but it is impossible for me to account for every scenario.

-*Remember to always make a back up of files before making changes*
